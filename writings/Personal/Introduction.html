        <article class="content">
            <p>After making my website months ago, I am finally here to create my first writing. The best way to start off is with my aspirations, since I feel like that is the only thing I have. While it wont be forever, and I will achieve success. What does success mean to me? When I think about success the first thing I think about is independence, but yet that feels like it would be a typical response coming from me. Honestly, I feel like I am still seeking the superficial things. I want money, status, a loving and healthy relationship. Maybe that last one isnt superficial. Or maybe instead of money and status people confuse with, but truly desire is freedom and respect. I know this isnt really groundbreaking thining but not many people sit down to actually think things through with how many distractions are available today. The freedom to travel, spend invaluable time with friends and family, time to chase the dream they have been craving. That statement opens pandoras box though. If people genuinely had the time to pursue their dreams, how many actually would? Would I be one of them? Am I currently one of them? The same amount of time is available to us all. I know comparison is the thief of joy, but how are plenty of people my age setting themselves apart from me. We have had the same amount of time, but used the way we spent it differently. I need to be better. I do not want to run off of toxic fuel of the feeling of being inadequate. I say that will be my motivation to force me to be successful but this mindset has not gotten me very far currently. I need to re-frame myself and my way of thinking. Instead of thinking maybe I need to be doing something instead. Thinking may not be my issues, but the lack of it is. Constantly surrounded by media, television, any form of consumption turns my brain off and leads to inaction or pursuit of my dreams. Its time I grow up. </p>

            <p>Anyways, transitioning back to the original intention behind the writing.</p>

            <p>What is my goal?</p>

            <p>What is my dream?</p>

            <p>Those are very broad questions. I've been sitting here and thinking about those questions for quite some time now and have been drawing a blank. At first I was going to say I want to be useful, but I am more than that. Of course I want to grow financially, personally, and professionally. What does that mean? I want enough money to do the things that I enjoy, spend my time with the people I care about, be the best version of myself to set examples and help the ones I love, and dedicate my time and efforts to something greater than me. I say all of that but I don't know what that truly looks like.</p>

            <p>This is the purpose of my writing.</p>

            <p>Exactly why I want to document it as well, to display the personal growth I hope to attain in the future for the past and future me.</p>

            <p>Next writing I hope to touch up on my career. Where I am at currently, what I want to be doing for work and steps I need to take to achieve it.</p>

            <p>Until next time.</p>
